        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            If you've been craving the super savory Dot's pretzels—seasoned with buttermilk, butter, onion, garlic, and mustard—but can't find them near you, this recipe is a close second. We tried 4 different methods for replicating that buttery flavor and found starting with butter snaps pretzels is the best 
            (and easiest!) way. But if you can't find those either, add 1 teaspoon butter extract to your seasoning mix.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup canola or peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons dry buttermilk powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>8 ounces butter snaps pretzels</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together oil, buttermilk powder, garlic powder, onion powder, dry mustard, and salt in a large bowl. 
                Add pretzels and toss to coat evenly.</li>
            <li>Spread out in an even layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake until toasted, about 20 minutes, 
                stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes before serving. Store in an airtight 
                container at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
